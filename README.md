# rock-paper-scissors

Things I got to put into practice: 

- Creating functions and using parameters
- First experience using math methods (floor and random) in order to randomize the computer choice
- created variables and used those variables as paramters to play the game
- first experience with event handlers (onclick) in order to add a function to each button and getting the value of that respective button
- if/else statements to input the logic of defining what the computer move is and who wins each challenge
